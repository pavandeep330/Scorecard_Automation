Automate getting scores from cricbuzz data during a live match


we should open cricbuzz and open scorecard of a live ongoing match and then copy the link from the browser and copy it in the link variable
once we paste the link from the cricbuzz site and run the code , we can get the scores every minute until we stop the code from running .
